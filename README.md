# ft_printf (alvega-g)

This project consists of recoding and implementing a series of `printf` conversions, with the goal of creating your own `printf` function in C.

This function is already included in my `libft` library, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/ColmiiK/libft).

## Current conversions implemented
```
• %c
• %s
• %i
• %d
• %u
• %p
• %x
• %X
• %%
```
### Nota bene

Currently, this function does not return -1 when an error occurs, unlike the proper `printf` function.
